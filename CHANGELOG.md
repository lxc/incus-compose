# Changelog

All notable changes to incus-compose are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version numbering moved from `0.0.1` to `1.0.0` at beta11 (1.0.0 is the intended
final version), and the beta suffix gained a dot (`beta.16`) from beta.16 onward
for correct semver ordering. Headings below preserve each release's announced form.

## [1.1.0] - unreleased

### Changed

- `build:` now works on every platform instead of Linux/Unix-only: image
  building previously unpacked the built OCI image with `umoci` (gated to
  `unix && !darwin`, with a "not implemented" stub elsewhere), and now
  instead derives the minimal `config.json` needed by Incus's LXC driver
  (`Process.Args`/`Cwd`/`User`) straight from `<builder> inspect`, dropping
  the `opencontainers/image-spec` and `opencontainers/umoci` dependencies.
  Builder detection also no longer shells out to `<builder> version` to
  distinguish Podman from Docker; it now checks the resolved binary name,
  and `buildah` is tried alongside `podman`/`docker`. (by @jochumdev)
- Published ports (`ports:`) create a proxy device. On Incus 7.0+ the
  device uses NAT mode (`nat=true`) with ARP/NDP-based instance IP
  detection; on older servers it falls back to a userspace proxy
  targeting the container loopback (`nat=false`, connect `127.0.0.1`).
  (by @ishaan-jindal)
- `ic-healthd` is now event-driven instead of poll/SIGHUP-based: it discovers
  instances once, then reacts to the Incus lifecycle event stream (start,
  stop, shutdown, delete) to keep its tracked set in sync, spawning or
  killing checkers for exactly the delta. A checker only probes and reports
  its own status; the runner alone decides whether to restart an instance.
  `incus-compose healthd restart` no longer needs to register a client-side
  reloader hook, since healthd resyncs itself from events. (by @jochumdev)
- `up`'s wait for a service's own healthcheck to become healthy, and its
  wait on `depends_on: { condition: service_healthy }` dependencies, no
  longer poll Incus every 500ms. The client now opens a project-scoped
  Incus lifecycle event listener and blocks on a per-instance condition
  variable that's broadcast whenever that instance's state is refreshed
  from a lifecycle event (start/stop/update), cutting idle `GetInstance`
  API calls during `up`. (by @jochumdev)

### Removed

- `x-incus-compose.nat-proxy` extension and all associated post-start
  device attachment machinery. Ports are now handled entirely through
  the standard `ports:` field. (by @ishaan-jindal)

### Added

- `services.{name}.configs` / top-level `configs:`: mount config files into
  the container, sourced from a file, inline `content`, or an environment
  variable. `mode` defaults to `0444` (world-readable); the writable bit is
  always ignored per the compose-spec, even if an explicit `mode` is set.
  (by @ishaan-jindal)
- Well-known OCI registries (`docker.io`, `ghcr.io`, `mcr.microsoft.com`,
  `quay.io`, `registry.gitlab.com`) are now auto-added to the in-memory Incus CLI config
  when an image from that registry is used, removing the need for manual
  `incus remote add` steps. (by @ishaan-jindal)
- Do not ignore healthd in `up --no-deps <service>` it allows script to wait
  on the service to be ready. Use `up --no-deps --no-healthd <service>` if you
  want the old behaviour. (by @jochumdev)
- `x-incus-compose.healthd.external: true`: the compose-file equivalent of
  `up --external-healthd` / `down --external-healthd`, so a project can pin
  "bring your own healthd" permanently instead of passing the flag on every
  invocation. Combines with the flag by OR: either is enough to turn it on.
  (by @jochumdev)
- `networks.{name}.aliases` on a service's network attachment now registers
  extra DNS names for its instance: each alias becomes a
  `cname=<alias>,<instance>` record in the network's `raw.dnsmasq`, resolving
  immediately instead of waiting on a DHCP lease like the existing
  service-name records. Works across networks shared between projects
  (`external: true`) without clobbering the other project's records. Limited
  to single-instance services, since a CNAME alias can only point at one
  target. (by @jochumdev)
- `dns` / `dns_search` / `domainname` now map to Incus's `oci.dns.nameservers` /
  `oci.dns.search` / `oci.dns.domain` instance config keys, seeding the
  container's initial `/etc/resolv.conf`. `dns_opt` has no Incus equivalent
  and is not mapped. (by @jochumdev)

### Fixed

- `install.sh`: fixed the checksum filename to match goreleaser's current
  release-artifact naming (`checksums.txt`), it was still using the old
  `${PROJECT_NAME}_${VERSION}_checksums.txt` pattern. (by @jochumdev)
- `up --pull=always` and `pull`: the stale image was not always deleted from
  cache and project before re-copying, so a floating tag could keep serving
  the old image. Deleting the cache is now a distinct step that runs before
  create/refresh, and the well-known-registry hook fires on it too. (by @jochumdev)
- Image caching: images built with `build:` now go through the same cache
  path as pulled images instead of being created directly in the project,
  fixing stale/duplicate builds when a cache is configured. `deleteCached`
  also no longer aborts before cleaning up the cache when the source image
  was already removed. (by @jochumdev)

### Internal

- `.golangci.yml`: enabled a much stricter linter set, and fixed the
  resulting findings across the codebase. (by @jochumdev)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

The first stable release! _hooray_

### Changed

- Refactored the whole image caching process, it's now doing the same as
  the incus client would do and allows disabling caching by setting it to empty.
- `self-update` got a `--drafts` flag and skips them by default.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-07-08

Second release candidate cause of the breaking `user.` -> `user.label.` change below.

### Changed

- Labels now have a `user.label.` prefix instead `user.` only, to not conflict with
  other user settings.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-07

First release candidate. File pushes move to the Incus SFTP API, `command` now
layers on top of the image entrypoint instead of replacing it, and `privileged`
services are supported.

This is the first release that should actually work on Windows and MacOS.

E2E suite green.

### Added

- `services.{name}.privileged: true`: run the container privileged
  (`security.privileged`).

### Changed

- File pushes (secrets and single-file bind seeds) use the Incus SFTP API instead
  of the old REST file endpoint.
- `command:` is appended to the image's `oci.entrypoint` as arguments instead of
  overwriting it, matching Docker's ENTRYPOINT/CMD semantics.
- `ic-healthd` logs more detail during operations.
- `down --volumes` now deletes volumes while keeping the project; it is no longer
  an alias for `--project`. Use `--project` to remove the whole project (and its
  volumes).
- `list` includes the ic-healthd sidecar by default; the `--healthd` flag is
  replaced by `--no-healthd` to omit it.

### Fixed

- `healthd up` / `healthd down` work with custom networks.
- Windows and macOS builds error cleanly instead of crashing on the umoci import.

### Removed

- `healthd up --recreate`; recreate the sidecar with `healthd down` followed by
  `healthd up`.

### Internal

- CI runs slow tests with a 20m timeout and without parallelism to avoid overload;
  tooling paths and changelog links updated; lint fixes.

<details>
<summary><strong>Pre-1.0 beta history</strong> (beta1 through beta.22, 2026-06-01 to 2026-07-06)</summary>

## [1.0.0-beta.22] - 2026-07-06

A real `pull` command, Docker-parity `user` handling and `exec`, plus per-service
raw devices and gateway selection.

E2E suite green still at ~60% coverage.

### Added

- `pull` command: pre-pull service images (and the healthd sidecar) without
  creating anything, with `--policy`, `--ignore-buildable`,
  `--ignore-build-failures`, `--no-healthd`, and `--with-deps`.
- `services.{name}.user`: run the container process as a numeric `UID` or
  `UID:GID` (mapped to `oci.uid` / `oci.gid`).
- `services.{name}.x-incus-compose.devices`: attach raw Incus devices (gpu,
  unix-char, ...) verbatim; the required `type` key selects the device type.
- `services.{name}.networks.<net>.x-incus-compose.gateway: true`: places that NIC
  last so Incus uses its gateway as the instance's default route.

### Changed

- `exec` runs as the instance's user/group by default (matching
  `docker compose exec`); override with `--user` / `--group`. The command and its
  arguments are passed to Incus verbatim, so leading-dash flags work unescaped.
- Service network attachments are ordered deterministically (they previously
  followed Go map iteration order).
- Documentation moved to https://docs.incus-compose.org.

## [1.0.0-beta.21] - 2026-07-04

Standalone and bugfixed healthd, more x-incus reach, a native exec, and an error-severity system so recoverable problems warn instead of aborting.

E2E suite green, ~60% coverage.

### Added

- `x-incus` extensions now pass through on service networks, service volumes, and
  devices, plus direct `tmpfs` on services (same verbatim key/value passthrough as
  instances and networks).
- Standalone `ic-healthd`: it now has its own tests and can run on its own. Env
  vars renamed to the `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_*` prefix, and a `--token` flag was added.
- Error-severity system: `Clone()` and `IgnoreError()` let commands demote
  non-fatal problems to warnings instead of hard failures. `up`/`down`/`start`/
  `stop`/`restart` no longer abort on errors that don't matter.
- `StackFailFast()` and `Stack.SetOptions()`.
- Exported `SanitizeProjectName()`.

### Changed

- `exec` uses the native `incus exec` implementation instead of the in-house MVP
  terminal (~250 lines removed): better TTY handling and parity with the `incus` CLI.
- Overridden network names are honored for normal networks too, not just special cases.
- OCI config is extracted after a build; resource dedup now keys on both `Name()`
  and `IncusName()`.

### Fixed

- Instance volumes land on the correct storage pool.
- `security.shifted` is left alone when the user has set it.
- `progress.bypass()` for all stdout/stderr fixes garbled output (#37).
- DNS watcher is skipped when the service name equals the Incus name; no watcher
  for empty service names.

## [1.0.0-beta.20] - 2026-06-30

Internal project/stack refactor plus network-readiness and healthd reliability
fixes.

E2E suite green, ~50% coverage.

### Added

- Instances wait for the network before starting via `raw.lxc=lxc.start.delay=1`,
  fixing flaky startups where services came up before DNS/networking was usable.

### Changed

- Reworked the ordering logic for `up`/`down`/`start`/`stop`, with and without
  dependencies. Deliberate asymmetry: `up`/`down` follow `depends_on` by default
  (`--no-deps` limits to the named service); `start`/`stop`/`restart` act on the
  named service only (`--with-deps` makes them follow `depends_on`).
- Project no longer returns a `Stack`; the CLI now owns stack assembly, with a new
  helper that adds resources in priority order.
- Exported `SanitizeNetworkName`.

### Fixed

- DNS update retries once on an ETag mismatch (concurrent-update race).
- `user.healthchecking.stopped` updates go through a cleaner path; the hacky PATCH
  workaround is gone.

### Removed

- deb/rpm/apk packages. Releases now ship the tarball/binary and install script only.

## [1.0.0-beta.19] - 2026-06-29

Mostly CLI and healthd fixes, plus event-driven log following.

### Added

- Event-driven `logs --follow`: uses the Incus events API to attach and detach log
  streams as instances start and stop, no longer exiting when instances go away and
  picking up new instances automatically (#3).

### Changed

- `down --project` now deletes all resources (instances, networks, volumes, and the
  healthd sidecar) instead of relying on incus to do so.
- `--debug` no longer shows progress bars (they interfered with debug output).
- DNS watcher waits up to 5s after a dnsmasq restart before starting the next instance.

### Fixed

- healthd: restart counting during the start period, instance tracking after
  cancellation, and the `healthd up`/`healthd down` lifecycle (#5).

### Removed

- Automatic retry on client operations.
- The unnecessary `--with-deps` flag from `logs`.

### Docs

- Added a Terms section (#4); updated example healthchecks with `start_*` directives;
  immich example now waits for DNS readiness and drops tini.

## [1.0.0-beta.18] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed the `--project-directory` shorthand from `-pd` to `-P`.
- **Breaking:** `core.https_address` is now required (the server must be reachable
  over the network for image caching); the CLI warns when connecting over a unix socket.
- Lowered the default `--workers` from 10 back to 4 to avoid storage IO contention on
  cold-cache / large-image starts.
- Use the non-`v` version for the healthd image while keeping the `v` prefix for
  incus-compose itself.

### Fixed

- Retry various client/CLI operations and tune the default timeouts; increased the
  delay between start/stop retries.
- `up --recreate` no longer recreates networks.
- `ic-healthd` no longer shows up as an orphan in `ps` output.
- healthd always restarts checkers on reload so new settings take effect.
- Silenced two noisy debug logs.

## [1.0.0-beta.17] - 2026-06-27

Hotfix on top of beta.16, focused on the health-check sidecar.

### Added

- Opt-out of volume shifting (`security.shifted`) for cases where matching IDs
  inside the container don't matter.

### Fixed

- `ic-healthd` now runs inside the project stack and attaches to the project's own
  network (the project default unless overridden via `x-incus-compose.healthd.network`),
  ensured just before regular instances. Network extra options are no longer lost.

## [1.0.0-beta.16] - 2026-06-26

Requires updating via the install script (version format changed to `beta.XX` for
a correct semver version).

### Added

- `list` now has a separate `HEALTH` column instead of appending health to `STATUS`
  (columns: KIND, NAME, INCUSNAME, IMAGE, STATUS, HEALTH, ADDRESSES).
- Every instance reports a health value; services without a healthcheck show
  "Unknown" rather than a blank.
- `up`/`start` wait for the healthcheck to report healthy after starting an instance
  that defines one (polled every 500ms, bounded by `--timeout`), making
  `depends_on: service_healthy` reliable.
- `ic-healthd` reports its own status (healthy on start, unhealthy on shutdown) and
  locates the daemon instance via a `user.healthcheck.daemon` marker.
- New `--healthd-incus` flag / `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_INCUS` env var to set the API
  URL the sidecar connects to (empty = auto-detect the IP from the attached bridge).
- New top-level `x-incus-compose.healthd` extension (`incus` API URL and `network`
  as `<project>:<network>` or a plain bridge name; both default to the project's own
  network and the connection's port).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** compose now defaults to incus listening on all interfaces; set
  `INCUS_COMPOSE_HEALTHD_INCUS` to override.
- `up` reconciles the service count in both directions, matching `docker compose up`.
  Instances above the desired count (`deploy.replicas` or `--scale`) are torn down,
  highest index first. A manual `--scale N` applies only to that invocation (#12).
- Default `--timeout` raised from 10s to 1 minute.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** the defunct `x-incus-compose.network-profile` extension (replaced by
  `x-incus-compose.healthd`).

## [1.0.0-beta15] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `self-update` command: checks GitHub releases and updates the binary in place
  (release builds only, when the binary directory is writable).
- Environment variables for all CLI flags; every global flag can now be set via
  `INCUS_COMPOSE_*` (e.g. `INCUS_COMPOSE_FILE`, `INCUS_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`,
  `INCUS_COMPOSE_DEBUG`).
- Configurable worker count via `--workers` / `INCUS_COMPOSE_WORKERS` (default 10).

### Fixed

- `.incus.yaml` overlay loading: `docker-compose.incus.yaml` and `compose.incus.yaml`
  overlays were not loaded correctly (#6).
- Progress display and error rendering improvements (#7).
- healthd retry calculation: `retries = start_period / start_interval`.
- Small client-package cleanups.

### Docs

- Improved healthd documentation.

## [1.0.0-beta14] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Network project/profile support: `x-incus-compose.network.project` and
  `x-incus-compose.network.profile` control which Incus project and profile healthd uses.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** bind-mounts are no longer seeded by default; they now default to
  non-seeded (simple disk device pass-through). Set `x-incus-compose.seed: true` on
  the volume to restore copying files into the instance.

### Fixed

- Client connection stability: fixed several data races (reused `ProtocolIncus`,
  `noColor` context var, random string generation).
- Network profile fallback: use `devices.eth0.parent` when `devices.eth0.network`
  isn't available in a profile.
- More robust healthd discovery (`FindHealthd`).
- Switched to `errors.As()` for proper error unwrapping.

### Internal

- Removed all remaining testify/suite usage; refactored `serviceToInstance()` into
  smaller helpers; split `project/project.go` into smaller files; removed dangling
  test fixtures; updated snapshots for the new bind-mount behavior.

## [1.0.0-beta13] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- incus-compose is now part of the **lxc** organization on GitHub.
- The `main` branch entered a feature freeze ahead of 1.0.0.

### Fixed

- Do not assume the availability of `incusbr0`.

## [1.0.0-beta12] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- `--image-cache` global flag (`INCUS_COMPOSE_IMAGE_CACHE`) to point the image cache
  at a different Incus project (default: `default`).
- `--rmi` / `--images` on `down` to remove project images on teardown, matching
  docker compose behaviour.
- Extra storage volume config support via `x-incus-compose`.

### Fixed

- `--with-deps` scoping: `up`/`down` follow `depends_on` automatically; all other
  commands require an explicit `--with-deps`.
- Healthd is now skipped when no services require it.
- Build image name corrected to `localhost/<service>`.

## [1.0.0-beta11] - 2026-06-11

Moved to 1.0.0 from 0.0.1 (1.0.0 will be the final version). Mostly a
health/dependency/lifecycle hardening release.

### Added

- Healthy-dependency support: `up` wires `service_healthy` dependencies into start
  ordering/waiting; new `--dependency-timeout` flag.
- Healthd expanded and rewritten: now runs when services use restart policies or are
  depended on via `service_healthy`, not only for an explicit healthcheck. Supports
  `start_period`, `start_interval`, `interval`, `timeout`, and `retries`; health
  state standardized via `user.healthcheck.status`.
- `shm_size` maps to a `/dev/shm` tmpfs device.
- `container_name` support: used as the Incus instance name; scaled services become
  `container_name-1`, `container_name-2`, etc.
- Added `examples/many-dependencies` and `examples/wikijs`; moved
  `test/fixtures/immich` to `examples/immich`; timestamped test logs under
  `test/logs/`; added `just test-slow`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** removed the direct Incus URL env vars from the documented/runtime
  connection flow (`INCUS_COMPOSE_URL`, `INCUS_COMPOSE_CERT`, `INCUS_COMPOSE_KEY`).
  Use Incus CLI remotes instead (`--remote`, `INCUS_REMOTE`, or the default remote).
- **Breaking:** timeout flags changed from integer seconds to Go duration values
  internally (`up`, `down`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, healthd paths); use explicit
  durations like `--timeout 10s`.
- **Breaking:** healthd sidecar name changed to `{project}-ic-healthd`; scripts
  expecting plain `ic-healthd` need updating.
- Improved CLI progress: healthd commands participate, progress moved to stdout and
  is less likely to corrupt logs.
- DNS watcher rewritten for concurrent per-action updates; instance IP handling
  refactored to support multiple interfaces/IP sets.

### Fixed

- `exec` now targets the requested service instead of possibly choosing the wrong
  instance from the stack.
- `list`/`ps` output is sorted for deterministic output (#46).
- Progress no longer overwrites logs (#43), plus several writer/stdout/stderr fixes.
- Healthd stability: graceful deletion/reload, checker optimization, and the normal
  checker now starts correctly after the start-period checker succeeds.
- Instance lifecycle: fixes around already-running instances and recreate; Incus
  timeout `0` means "do not wait", so the internal default now maps to `-1` where needed.
- Storage volumes: better shifted-volume validation, delayed from `Ensure()` to
  `Start()` where runtime UID/GID data is available.
- Image properties are copied correctly instead of sharing/mutating state.
- Several fixes around deleting project, external, and managed/dangling networks.
- Uses `errors.Is(err, ErrNotFound)` in more places; better debug logging and wrapping.

## [0.0.1-beta10] - 2026-06-08

Making Compose workflows more complete: local image builds, better progress
feedback, and improved healthcheck restart behavior.

### Added

- Compose `build:` support. New commands and flags: `incus-compose build`,
  `incus-compose build <svc...>`, `up --build`, `up --no-build`. See `docs/build.md`.
- Progress output for all operations in the CLI.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** no more Windows client support (a consequence of adding build; file
  an issue if you need it).
- **Breaking:** storage volume names changed to `vol-{name}` (was `{project}-{name}`),
  hashed if longer than 59 chars. Existing volumes are not migrated automatically.
- `ic-healthd` restart backoff (5s -> 10s -> 20s -> 40s -> 60s max) avoids tight
  restart loops for unhealthy services.
- `restart: unless-stopped` handled more correctly: `stop` marks `user.stopped=true`,
  `start` clears it, and `ic-healthd` skips automatic restarts while a service was
  intentionally stopped.

### Fixed

- Bind-mounted directories now resolve through the actual Incus storage volume name.
- Copied files/directories use more normal permissions: `0644` / `0755`.
- Fixed a UID/GID copy bug.

## [0.0.1-beta9] - 2026-06-07

Major image-handling rework, plus volume/bind-mount and healthd changes.

### Changed

- OCI config is extracted at download time: UID, GID, entrypoint, and cwd are read
  from a temporary stopped container right after download and stored as image
  properties (`oci.uid`, `oci.gid`, etc.) via `UpdateImage`; later runs read them
  back from properties with no extra container.
- Two-stage image cache restored (source -> cache project -> instance project),
  along with `docs/architecture/client/image.md`.
- Deferred source/cache detection: `GetImageServer` and `EnsureProject` moved from
  `newImage()` into `Ensure()`, so no network connections happen during the
  configuration phase (fixing CI slowness).
- Resource deduplication: `ResourceStore.Get` now compares by `IncusName()`, so
  normalized references (`docker.io/nginx:alpine` vs `docker.io/library/nginx:alpine`)
  return the same object, preventing duplicate alias races.
- Bind-mount files are pushed post-start via `InstanceFile`; bind-mount directories
  become storage volumes with `HostPath` seeding on create. `PostDevices` and
  `ActionPostEnsure` are removed; volumes live in `Devices` and are ensured before
  `CreateInstanceFromImage`.
- Healthd resource removed: the `client.Healthd` wrapper is replaced by
  `healthdUp`/`healthdDown` helpers in `cmd/incus-compose/healthd.go`. `KindHealthd`,
  `HealthdConfig`, and `resource_healthd.go` are deleted.
- Healthd instance is prefixed with the project name to prevent cross-project collisions.

### Fixed

- Skip token registration when a cert already exists (prevents repeated
  re-registration on `ic-healthd` restart).
- `down` network-listing failure during `--project` delete is demoted to a warning;
  a nil-check prevents a panic when listing fails.

### Internal

- justfile version tags gained `--long --dirty` for healthd builds.

### Breaking

- Removed the project name from storage volume names (manual migration required;
  note beta10 renamed volumes again to `vol-{name}`).

## [0.0.1-beta8] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- `list --healthd`: opt-in flag to include the `ic-healthd` sidecar in list output.
- `up --detach|-d`: detach after starting services; logs are printed if not detached (#38).
- `incus-compose incus proxy`: pass-through command (`incus --project={name} <xyz>`) (#37).
- Image name in `ps`/`list`: the IMAGE column is populated for all instances,
  including the healthd sidecar, without requiring Image resources in read-only
  stacks (stored as `user.image_alias` at creation, resolved from
  `volatile.base_image` as a fallback).
- healthd resource limits: the sidecar is capped at 1 CPU and 50 MB RAM by default
  (required for project-wide limits).
- `ic-healthd` now compiles in and prints its version.
- `oci-registry-cache` promoted to a standalone helper project.

### Changed

- `healthd restart` works as intended: kill a service and healthd brings it back.
- **Breaking:** `--no-pull` replaced by `--pull` (string flag) for docker compose
  compatibility.

### Fixed

- `down` no longer deletes externally-managed networks.
- healthd: fixed API endpoint resolution when connecting to the Incus socket (#39).
- Various fixes for projects that attach to pre-existing external networks.

## [0.0.1-beta7] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `incus-compose healthd` subcommand group for direct sidecar management:
  `logs` (stream), `reload` (reload health-check config), `restart`, `up`
  (recreate, `--recreate` supported), and `down`.
- External network name override via `x-incus-compose.network`: networks can declare
  their real Incus name independently of the compose key. Name resolution uses a
  4-candidate probe (raw and sanitized, for both the override and the compose name)
  and locks in the first match.

### Fixed

- serviceName truncation regression: hyphenated service names (e.g. `my-service`)
  were incorrectly stripped. Only trailing `-{n}` integer suffixes (the scaled
  instance convention) are now removed.
- `ic-healthd` now appears in `list`/`ps` output.
- Hardcoded default storage pool: `ic-healthd` resources now use the client's
  configured `DefaultStoragePool` instead of always `"default"`.
- `up --recreate` on a healthd container no longer loses `--incus`/`--project` OCI
  entrypoint flags; `ResourceStore.Remove()` is now called on every `Delete()`.

## [0.0.1-beta5] / [0.0.1-beta6] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Automatic loading of a `compose.incus.yaml` override file when present next to the
  main Compose file, keeping upstream Docker Compose files unchanged while adding
  Incus-specific configuration in a separate file.

### Changed

- The `ic-healthd` image now uses `busybox:glibc` instead of `scratch`.

## [0.0.1-beta4] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- `x-incus` options: Compose services can pass raw Incus instance config directly
  through to Incus (memory/CPU limits, nesting, security flags, etc.).
- Automatic loading of the default incus profile.
- Project-wide `x-incus-compose.network-profile` support (disables a per-project
  default network/bridge).
- healthd reload on service changes.

### Fixed

- Network creation race that could cause dnsmasq failures in CI (avoids immediately
  updating a newly-created network before the old dnsmasq released its socket).
- `down` now deletes compose-managed networks when the project is brought down,
  fixing dangling networks.
- `up --no-pull` is now respected correctly (also ~2x faster test runs, 3min from 6min).

### Testing

- Test coverage +17% (35% -> 52%).

## [0.0.1-beta3] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Kernel-mode NAT proxy for port proxies via `x-incus.nat-proxy` (#30).
- DHCP ranges and static IPv4 / IPv6 addresses on network creation.

### Fixed

- Healthd status in `ps`/`list`.
- Scaling now prunes dangling instances when `up --scale` lowers the count (#34).
- `logs` omits old logs then follows when `--follow` is set.
- Small fixes to keep CI green.

## [0.0.1-beta1] - 2026-06-01

Initial public beta. A ground-up Docker Compose workflow for Incus, inspired by
Brian Ketelsen's proof-of-concept.

### Added

- Familiar commands: `up`, `down`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `list` (and `ps`),
  `logs`, `exec`, `config`, plus `build`, `healthd`, `incus` (pass-through), and
  `self-update`.
- Compose project parsing via compose-go, with automatic `compose.incus.yaml`
  overrides and `x-incus` / `x-incus-compose` extensions for raw Incus options.
- Native OCI image pulling from docker.io, ghcr.io, and other registries.
- Two-stage image cache in a dedicated Incus project (survives `down`/`up`, avoids
  registry rate limits).
- Local image building via Podman/Docker.
- Bridge networks with automatic name sanitization.
- Static IPv4/IPv6 addresses with automatic DHCP ranges.
- Port forwarding via proxy devices or kernel NAT mode.
- Storage volumes with UID/GID shifting; bind mounts (pass-through by default,
  optional seeding).
- Health checks, restart policies, and `depends_on: service_healthy` ordering via
  the `ic-healthd` sidecar.
- Service scaling with `up --scale` and orphan pruning.
- Incus project isolation.
- Resource limits and other advanced compose features (`shm_size`,
  `container_name`, etc.).
- Configuration via `INCUS_COMPOSE_*` environment variables for every flag, with a
  configurable parallel worker count.
