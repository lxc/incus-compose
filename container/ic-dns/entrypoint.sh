# Sets GOMEMLIMIT from the cgroup memory limit, then execs ic-dns with whatever
# arguments it was given.
#
# Without it nothing bounds the Go heap: the goal is roughly twice the live heap
# and the live heap tracks the fleet, so a limit that fits 480 instances is a
# limit that OOM-kills at 4800. GOMEMLIMIT turns that into more GC instead - the
# runtime collects and scavenges harder as it approaches, rather than growing
# past a ceiling it does not know about.
#
# The limit is what cgroup2 charges, which is anon plus page cache plus kernel
# memory plus socket buffers - and only anon is Go's. The binary's own text is
# tens of MiB of page cache, so a percentage of the limit is the reserve, not a
# rounding error. GOMEMLIMIT_PERCENT tunes it; an explicit GOMEMLIMIT wins over
# both and is left alone.
#
# See benchmarks/ic-dns/benchmark.md, "Running it under a memory limit", for
# the measurements these defaults come from.

# GOMEMLIMIT is the ceiling; GOGC is what paces collection under it, and left at
# its default of 100 the two do not meet. The heap is collected at roughly twice
# the live heap - 12 MB against a 75 MB limit for a 480-instance fleet - so the
# limit never binds and the collector runs constantly: 7.7% of CPU under a
# saturating run, against 2.1% at 400, for 4.3% less CPU per query.
#
# Raising it is safe precisely because GOMEMLIMIT is there. This names a target
# of five times the live heap; the limit is what caps that, so a fleet big enough
# for five times to exceed the cgroup gets paced by the ceiling rather than by
# this. Peak memory did not move: 61 MiB of a 100 MiB limit either way.

# The usual entrypoint shape: no arguments, or a first one that looks like a
# flag, means ic-dns is what is being run and the binary goes in front. Anything
# else is executed as given, so `sh` still gets you a shell in here.
#
# By name rather than by path, so PATH decides which one - an ic-dns built
# somewhere else and mounted over it needs no change here. It lives in /usr/bin
# because nothing sets PATH for this container: the shell's built-in fallback is
# what resolves the name, and that covers /usr/bin but not /usr/local/bin.
# Anything that is not itself runnable is arguments for ic-dns. It used to be
# "empty, or starts with a dash", which was right when the binary took flags
# alone - the first argument is a subcommand now, and `run` matched neither.
#
# command -v rather than a list of subcommands, so this does not go stale every
# time one is added, and `entrypoint.sh sh` still gets a shell to debug in.
