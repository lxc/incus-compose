# hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-source static site
generators: fast builds, no runtime dependencies.

The files for this example are on
[Github](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose/tree/main/examples/hugo).

## The example

A single `blog` service builds and serves the site via a multi-stage
`Dockerfile` defined inline with `dockerfile_inline`:

1. `alpine` installs Hugo and builds `site/` into `public/`, using the
   `BASE_URL` build arg for `hugo build -b`.
2. `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:alpine` serves the built `public/` directory.

`compose.incus.yaml` overrides `BASE_URL` with the container's static IP so Hugo
generates correct absolute links, and adds the static IP, a healthcheck, and a
CPU limit.

## Usage

```bash
incus-compose up
```
