# Kimai

[Kimai](https://www.kimai.org/en/), an open-source time-tracking application,
backed by MariaDB.

The files for this example are on
[Github](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose/tree/main/examples/kimai).

## The example

Two services: `mariadb` and `kimai`. Database credentials are passed as Compose
`secrets` sourced from environment variables (`db-password`, `db-root-password`,
`db-my-cnf`) rather than plain `environment:` entries, keeping them out of the
rendered container config. All values come from `.env`.

## Usage

```bash
incus-compose up
```
