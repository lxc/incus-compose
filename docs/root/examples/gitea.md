# Gitea

[Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), a lightweight self-hosted Git service, backed
by Postgres.

The files for this example are on
[Github](https://github.com/lxc/incus-compose/tree/main/examples/gitea).

## The example

Two services: `database` (Postgres) and `gitea`, wired together with
`depends_on: condition: service_healthy`. Versions, credentials, and network
settings all come from `.env`.

## Usage

```bash
incus-compose up
```
