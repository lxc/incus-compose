# dns

The DNS half of the chain: it folds events into records and answers queries from
them. What it serves for an operator is [[dns|the ic-dns page]]; this is how it
is built.

## A Plugin Owns What It Serves

It is not a plugin that hands records to a server somewhere else. It holds the
engine, starts the listener, and puts the forwarder after itself, so `main`
composes a chain and knows nothing about DNS - which is what lets a second
binary be a copy of `main` with a different list.

Its listener outlives its fold loop. Answering from the last snapshot while the
chain drains beats refusing, and the two cannot hurt each other: one goroutine
writes an `atomic.Pointer` and every query goroutine reads it. That is the only
crossing in the package, and it is why there is no lock in it.

It serves UDP and TCP together, always: a truncated UDP reply is only useful to
a client that can retry over TCP. A panic from the query chain after the engine
is recovered and answered SERVFAIL - the one place in this package that recovers
at all, unlike the rest of the ievent chain, because `Chain` is arbitrary
CoreDNS plugins this package did not write and cannot vouch for. The adapter
answering these is hand-shaped after CoreDNS's own `dnsserver.Server.ServeDNS`,
less what a single-chain binary has no use for - server blocks, views, proxy
protocol - and has to be diffed by hand against upstream on every CoreDNS bump.

## Two Halves, One Atomic Pointer

```
events -> fold -> build -> Snapshot -> atomic store
                                          |
query -----------------------------> atomic load
```

**Work happens when things change, not when queries arrive.** A whole-fleet
snapshot is built when something moves, records rendered and filtered ahead of
time, and answering is then three map lookups - no filtering, no intersection,
no I/O. A query never touches Incus.

## The Engine Derives Nothing

`ecs_view`, under here, holds the records and answers. It knows nothing about
Incus, and `just boundary` enforces that it cannot even see where a record came
from. What keeps the query path free of derivation is that it _cannot_ derive.

A view is a set of network keys. The answer to a query depends on the querier
only through that set, so every querier on the same set gets identical answers
and they share one view.

## Placing The Querier

A querier is identified two ways: an EDNS0 client-subnet option, if a resolver
relayed one, otherwise the query's own source address - the option wins, since a
resolver forwarding on a client's behalf puts that client's address there for
every query it relays.

That address is checked against an instance's own claim first, and only then
against which known subnets it falls inside. Belonging to no host but sitting
inside one or more known networks makes it an anonymous member of all of them,
which is what lets something elsewhere on a bridge resolve records for the other
hosts on that bridge without being one itself.

An address that cannot be placed on any network at all is refused outright,
never answered from everything: there is no default view, because guessing would
leak one network's records to a querier on another, and a real client is always
on some network this server knows about. The zone apex is the one answer that
does not vary by querier - its scope is left at 0 so a resolver caching an
echoed subnet reply may share it fleet-wide - everything else is scoped to the
querier's whole address, since a different address may be a different view.

## Building Is Fleet-Wide, Never Per Project

A set of networks can span projects: two instances on one shared bridge sit in
different projects and different zones while being on the same wire. Building
per project could only ever fill a view with the names of whichever project
built it, so those two would go mutually blind - and both halves of that read as
NXDOMAIN, which is indistinguishable from correct isolation.

## Labels Layer, Project Under Instance

A project's own `dns.*` labels are the defaults its instances start from; an
instance's own labels override them field by field. `ns` and `transfer` are the
exceptions: a name server and the decision to hand a zone over are the zone's,
so both are read off the project alone and dropped if an instance sets them. Two
projects resolving to one zone name union, so either one's `transfer` opts it
in. `aliases` is the reverse exception - it never inherits, since a project-wide
alias would claim one name for every instance in it.

The zone itself is `<project>.<suffix>` unless `user.label.dns.zone` names one
instead. The name a scaled service answers to is `user.label.dns.service`, or
`incus-compose.service` when compose set it - compose wins, so a fleet built
from a compose file is named by the file that owns it and not by a label
somebody typed once by hand.

## Forward Names

Held by project **and** name, because two projects may each have a `web` and
they are different hosts in different zones.

- `<instance>.<zone>` always
- `<service>.<zone>` when labelled - a scaled service's replicas append to one
  slice, which is all "a service name resolves to every replica" means
- aliases, as CNAMEs

An address claimed by more than one instance resolves to `AmbiguousView` rather
than to either of them. Two projects on overlapping subnets really can hand out
the same one, and deciding by map order would answer a querier with the other's
view, non-deterministically.

## Aliases And CNAMEs

`user.label.dns.aliases` becomes a CNAME onto `<instance>.<zone>` rather than a
second copy of the addresses, so a host that moves changes them in one place.

Rendered per network key from the target's own rendered records, which is what
makes an alias reach exactly as far as the name it points at and never wider.
The chase is done at build time - the CNAME goes into the A and AAAA sets as
well as its own, canonical name first - so answering through one stays three map
lookups.

One CNAME value serves every network the name is reachable on, since it is the
one record that does not vary by network. It is written into each of those
views, and a querier resolves to exactly one of them, so nothing has to
de-duplicate it at query time.

An alias is dropped, never resolved by picking, when it collides: a name a host
or service already answers to, a name two instances both claim, or a zone apex.
Each would put a CNAME beside other records or two CNAMEs at one name.

An absolute alias landing outside every zone gets one invented for its parent,
marked `Fallthrough`: that zone claims the aliased names and hands everything
else to the forwarder, so one label on one instance cannot blackhole a domain
the fleet still resolves. A name it _does_ hold is answered under the ordinary
rule, invisible included, so falling through cannot be used to tell a hidden
name from an absent one.

## Reverse Records

Every address is filed backwards under the name `dns.ReverseAddr` gives it,
keyed by the same network the forward record is keyed by. That keying is the
whole of it: a PTR is stored per view exactly as its forward name is, so an
address on a network the querier is not on reads as NXDOMAIN exactly as its
forward name does.

A reverse zone is the `/24` or `/64` an address lands in, taken from **the
address rather than from its network's prefix**. A subnet Incus manages but
nothing sits on is therefore never claimed. Where a bridge is the usual `/24` or
`/64` the two derivations agree; where it is a `/22`, deriving from the prefix
would make this server authoritative for the enclosing `/16`.

The network's prefixes still decide _whether_ there is a reverse at all: an
address outside every prefix of the network it sits on is served forward and not
backward. One instance bridged onto a public `/24` would otherwise have this
server answering NXDOMAIN for the rest of it. It is the one place the two
directions deliberately disagree.

## NS Records

`Zone.NS` is the apex NS set, read straight off `user.label.dns.ns` and resolved
against the zone the way an alias is - a trailing dot absolute, anything else
relative. Empty falls back to a placeholder name nothing answers for, harmless
until the zone is transferred or delegated.

It is not derived from the fleet. A secondary that would receive it is outside
the fleet, or it would not need a transfer, so there is nothing in `held` to
read it off - the operator's own list, typed once at the delegation's parent, is
the only source there is.

Two projects resolving to one zone name union their `ns` labels into one set,
the same way their instances union into one zone. A reverse zone unions every
contributing project's `ns`, since it belongs to no project of its own.

A zone `aliasZones` invents for one absolute alias never gets one: it is
`Fallthrough`, so `Answer` never reaches the apex branch for it, and handing a
name server for a domain this server holds one name in would make it
authoritative for the rest of that domain too.

## Zone Serials

A zone's serial moves when that zone's records move and at no other time. **A
patch marks the zone it touched**, and publish steps every zone carrying a mark

- a bool says what a digest over the instances was working out, and it went with
  the rebuild it existed for. Reachability is covered without a special case: a
  patch is what moves an instance between networks, so the mark lands whether or
  not any address changed.

A serial is stepped only while the chain is warm. A step is a claim that the
zone changed, and cold has confirmed nothing, so it has no standing to make one.
Its first publish is a birth rather than a step, since a secondary reads zero as
"no zone here".

The plugin stamps it because it is the only thing that knows what it published
last - the engine is a read-only view and holds nothing to compare against.

## Zone Transfer

AXFR and IXFR are answered by `xfr`, a position of its own ahead of the engine
in the query chain, from a snapshot **published to it separately**. The engine's
pointer is not read through: a transfer is the one answer not filtered by who is
asking, so it derives what the query path is built not to, and one
`atomic.Pointer` with one writer is cheaper than a second reader of somebody
else's. `publish` writes the same finished value twice.

Both answer from that snapshot rather than a journal - there is no delta to cut,
so an IXFR asking for anything but the serial already served gets the whole zone
anyway. UDP is refused outright; a transfer is a stream of messages and UDP
carries one.

Two gates stand before the snapshot is even read: the peer's address against
`--allow-transfer` (no prefixes allows nobody, so transfer is opt-in at both the
zone's `transfer` label and the listener's config), and - once secrets are
configured - the request's TSIG status, which becomes the only assertion of who
the peer is once it exists. The request must name an apex: `ZoneOf` takes the
longest, so a name inside a zone resolves to the zone holding it and is refused
rather than served. A zone served without `Transfer`, and a `Shadowing` zone
invented for one absolute alias, are refused with no case of their own.

A zone goes over whole or not at all, which is the one answer here not filtered
by who is asking: every view a name holds is folded together rather than one
querier's, because the serial is per zone and not per view - two secondaries
handed different records under one serial could never tell that they had been.

**The name tree's keying is what enumerates a zone.** Names are keyed
root-first, so a zone is a byte-wise prefix of every name in it and one walk
finds them, in one deterministic order - two transfers of an unchanged zone are
the same byte stream without sorting anything. The same keying is why **every
name is checked back against `ZoneOf`**: a zone underneath this one is a prefix
match too, and carrying its names would hand a secondary a delegation nobody
made.

An alias shares its name with the records it was chased into, so a zone may not
hold both sets; on the wire the CNAME goes alone.

Everything is rendered and cut into envelopes - capped under the 64 KiB wire
limit, leaving room for the framing and a TSIG record - before the peer's
`Transfer.Out` reads any of it, off a channel that is already closed: nothing is
left running if the peer hangs up mid-stream, because there was never a producer
goroutine to hang.

## The Cold Store

With `ColdDir` set, every zone's serial is written to disk. Records come back
from the enricher's own store or an Incus fleet read; a serial cannot be
recovered from anywhere, and a secondary reading one going backwards
re-transfers on every restart of this process. Serials are the whole of it.

Encoding happens on the fold goroutine and writing on its own, so a slow disk
cannot stall the chain. What crosses between them is a finished `[]byte`, which
is why the writer _cannot_ reach into live state rather than merely not doing
so. One slot, and a queued encoding is discarded rather than waited on: a newer
one says everything it said.

The on-disk form is explicit types with explicit tags, because the file outlives
the process that wrote it - a field renamed in Go must not silently change what
a running deployment can read back. A file of any other version is ignored
rather than migrated, since this is a cache and starting without it costs one
whole-fleet read.

## The Chain Reconciles What Is Served

`dns` never reads Incus directly. It discards the connection at `Setup` and
learns about the fleet entirely through the chain: instances, networks, and
labels arrive as enriched events, and disappeared instances arrive as synthetic
`instance-deleted` events emitted by the enricher's round prune.

Patches collect in a 150ms `publishWindow` before a snapshot is published, so an
instance that moved and moved back inside one window compares equal and reaches
the trees not at all. On `enricher/sweep-end`, any pending window is flushed and
published immediately.

## Warm Is Not This Plugin's To Set

The enricher raises `ChainState: ChainWarm` on `enricher/sweep-end`, so warm has
already been stamped by the time that event reaches here. `dns` only reads it -
`step` takes it as whether a serial may move, since a step is a claim the zone
changed and cold has confirmed nothing.

## Readiness Is An Event

`dns` raises `dns/ready` through `Command` when what it published becomes worth
answering from. It does not hold a reference to [[developer/ievent/http|http]],
and http holds none to it: the event goes in at the head and is folded in order
against the events that caused it.

That announcement is for whoever is watching the chain. What `/ready` itself
latches on is `ChainState`, which rides on the same sweep-end - so the two agree
without either plugin knowing the other exists.

Edges rather than a level, so whoever folds them starts not-ready - the truth
before anything has been read.

## Known Gaps

- **Upstream metrics label off `metrics.WithServer`**, which reads a context key
  `core/dnsserver` sets - and nothing here runs it. So `coredns_cache_*` and
  friends carry `server=""`. Ours does not: `ecs_view` takes the name as a field
  at construction.
- **Any upstream plugin links `core/dnsserver`**, because each carries a
  `setup.go` in its own package and Go compiles a package whole. It is a toll
  paid once rather than per plugin - `forward` is 408 packages and `cache` 415,
  nearly the same set - costing 8.7 MiB of binary and nothing at runtime. A
  `-light` build is `main` with `queryChain` returning nil.
