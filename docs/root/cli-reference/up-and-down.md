Without `--detach`, `up` streams logs from all started services (equivalent to
running `logs --follow` immediately after). Use `--detach` to return as soon as
containers are started. `--no-start` implies it: there is nothing to stream logs
from.

For services with `build:`, `up` builds missing images by default. Use `--build`
to force a rebuild or `--no-build` to require the image to already exist.
`--build` also recreates the instances of the services whose image it rebuilt -
a rebuilt image only reaches an instance created from it again. Every other
service is left alone; `--recreate` is how you recreate the whole project. See
[Builds](/builds) for details.

`--pull always` recreates on the same rule: an instance whose image the refresh
replaced is torn down and made again from the new one. Only what the pull itself
replaced counts - under every other policy a running instance keeps the image it
was created from, even when the compose file now names a different one.

_Since: v1.3.0_

## down

Stop and remove containers. Per-project image copies are removed too; volumes
and the image cache are kept. Use `--volumes` to also delete volumes while
keeping the project, or `--project` to remove everything (project and volumes).

```
incus-compose down [SERVICE...]
```

| Option               | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--project`          | Remove the project (and its volumes)                                     |
| `--volumes`          | Also delete volumes, but keep the project                                |
| `--rmi`              | Remove images used by services: `local` or `all` (docker compose compat) |
| `--images`           | Remove known images from the project (equivalent to `--rmi local`)       |
| `--timeout`          | Stop timeout (default: 10s)                                              |
| `--no-deps`          | Don't stop linked services (depends_on)                                  |
| `--no-networks`      | Don't touch networks                                                     |
| `--external-healthd` | Use an existing (unmanaged) healthd; don't look one up                   |
| `--no-healthd`       | Don't stop/remove healthd sidecar                                        |

An instance takes its own volumes down with it, so `--volumes` reaches the ones
[an image declared](/compose-compatibility/volumes#image-volumes) as well. After
a plain `down` the instance is gone and there is nothing left to ask: those
volumes stay until `--project`, or until the next `up` recreates the instance
that owns them.

_Changed in 1.0.0-rc.1_: `--volumes` is now no more an alias for `--project` but
deletes volumes.

## Environment variables

Flags given on the command line win. See
[Environment Variables](/environment-variables) for the resolution order and the
flags that deliberately have none.
